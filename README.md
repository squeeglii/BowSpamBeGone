This project prevents bow-spam by forcing players to fully charge their bows in-order to shoot an arrow. It's a pretty small and simple mod without any configuration.


### Usage

This mod is *required* on the server-side in order to work. The mod is purely *optional* on the client-side. 

- When added to the server, bow-spam is prevented as arrow spawning is blocked unless the bow is fully drawn back.
- When added to the client, an audible tick is played when the bow is fully charged, to make the charge more obvious.
